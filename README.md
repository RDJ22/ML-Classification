## Project Overview

> This project explores classification models through both theoretical derivation and empirical application. In Q1, I derive the Gini impurity for Decision Trees and explain how Random Forests address overfitting using bootstrapping and feature bagging. In Q2, I apply Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM to the Iris dataset, tuning each model with cross-validation and comparing their performance using classification metrics.

- Derived the Gini Impurity for Decision Tree splitting  
- Explained improvements via *Random Forests* (bagging + bootstrapping)  
- Applied Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM to the **Iris dataset**  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation  
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Compared model performance on training and test sets
